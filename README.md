# AdventOfCode 2021

## Goal
This is my first Advent Of Code, and my goal is not get high in the leaderboard, is just to complete everything. 

## Tooling
I've choose to write my code in JavaScript, using the browser console as my tool. I choose that because is fast and easy. I don't have to compile or deal with environment problems.
I also use VSCode to maintaing a backup code, so I can use the browser as a sandbox and save the working code at VSCode. 
I'll try to use JavaScript as much as possible, let's see if I can handle it.
